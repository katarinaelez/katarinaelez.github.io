<p>
I am an early-career researcher in drug discovery, with experience in conducting and analyzing large-scale molecular simulations for medicinal chemistry and developing deep learning models for protein structure representation.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in the <a href="https://www.fu-berlin.de/">Artificial Intelligence for the Sciences group</a> at <a href="https://www.fu-berlin.de/">Free University of Berlin</a> and am a member of the <a href="https://www.molgen.mpg.de/IMPRS">IMPRS-BAC doctoral program</a> at <a href="https://www.molgen.mpg.de/">Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics</a>. I also hold an MSc in bioinformatics with honors from the <a href='https://www.unibo.it/en/'>University of Bologna</a>.
</p>

<p>
In my doctoral research, I have been focusing on computational drug discovery for inhibiting <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/O15393/">TMPRSS2</a> (a protease involved in coronavirus cell entry), using docking, molecular dynamics and active learning. This has led to the discovery of a nanomolar TMPRSS2 inhibitor and a <a href='https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/?q=pn%3DEP4122461A1'>patent application for treating COVID-19</a>. During my PhD, I have also gained valuable industry experience through an internship at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai-for-science/">Microsoft Research</a>.
</p>

<p>
Beyond my academic pursuits, I am passionate about teaching and science outreach, helping to inspire the next generation of scientists. Therefore, I have co-founded <a href="https://bioinform-org.github.io/">Bioinformatika</a>, an NGO dedicated to providing free educational content in bioinformatics to young people from all socio-economic backgrounds.
</p>

<p>
I am naturally drawn to problem-solving and genuinely motivated to tackle real-world challenges, particularly those with a potential for meaningful impact. Whether in academia or industry, I look forward to contributing to drug discovery, one computational model at a time.
