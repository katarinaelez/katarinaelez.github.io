I am an early-career researcher in drug discovery. My experience includes conducting and analyzing large-scale molecular simulations for medicinal chemistry, as well as developing deep learning models for protein structure representation.

Currently, I am a PhD student in bioinformatics at Freie Universit√§t Berlin and part of the <a href='https://www.molgen.mpg.de/IMPRS'>IMPRS-BAC doctoral program</a> at <a href='https://www.molgen.mpg.de/'>Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics</a>. In my doctoral research, I have been focusing on computational drug discovery for inhibiting TMPRSS2 (a protease involved in coronavirus cell entry), using docking, molecular dynamics and active learning. This has led to the discovery of a nanomolar TMPRSS2 inhibitor and a patent application for treating COVID-19. During my PhD, I have also gained valuable industry experience through an internship at <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai-for-science/'>Microsoft Research</a>.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I am passionate about teaching and science outreach, helping to inspire the next generation of scientists. Therefore, I have co-founded <a href='https://bioinform-org.github.io/'>Bioinformatika</a>, an NGO dedicated to providing free educational content in bioinformatics to young people from all socio-economic backgrounds.

I am naturally drawn to problem-solving and genuinely motivated to tackle real-world challenges, particularly those with a potential for meaningful impact. Whether in academia or industry, I look forward to contributing to drug discovery, one computational model at a time.
